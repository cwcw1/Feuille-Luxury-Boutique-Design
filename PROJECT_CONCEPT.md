# Feuille Luxury - Project Concept

## 🎯 Core Idea

**"Digital Luxury Boutique Experience"**

Transform online shopping from transactional to experiential by recreating the refined atmosphere of a high-end physical boutique through purposeful motion design.

---

## 🌿 Brand Identity

**Feuille** (French for "leaf") - Vancouver's premier luxury streetwear and designer boutique

**Positioning:**
- Premium, curated selection (Rick Owens, Maison Margiela, Yohji Yamamoto)
- Gallery-like presentation where each piece is special
- Modern sophistication, not mass-market

**Target Audience:** Fashion-forward individuals who value quality, curation, and experience over bargains

## 💡 Design Philosophy

### **"Elegant Minimalism with Purposeful Animation"**

**Core Principles:**

1. **Restraint = Luxury**
   - Every animation serves a purpose
   - No unnecessary decoration
   - Subtle, refined movements

2. **Slow & Deliberate**
   - 0.8s animations (not rushed)
   - Smooth easing (natural deceleration)
   - Time to appreciate details

3. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Content reveals as you scroll
   - Creates discovery and anticipation
   - Prevents overwhelm

4. **Gallery Presentation**
   - Staggered reveals like a personal stylist
   - Each product gets its moment
   - Curated, not catalog
